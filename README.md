# Overview

The following code is a simple game using Python arcade to teach younger students multiplication skills. The game is platformer styler and has the player is a dinosaur, running across multiple levels collecting numbers that are multiples of the number displayed above the player's head. If they collect a correct number, they are granted a speed boost and gain a score. The goal is to collect as many as possible and get to the end without falling or before the timer runs out.

The game was built using the built in python library, arcade, as well as some other software such as Tiled which allowed us to build tilemaps from PNG assets.

# Future Work

* In our menu, we have an option to change the color of the character. There are four options: Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green. However the menu function does not work currently so the default is set to Red.
* We also plan on implementing larger numbers for teaching multiplication tables. Currently we only use numbers 0-9.
* We also would like to add a log of all the right and wrong answers for the player to see at the end of the game.
